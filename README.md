2. **Message Queuing System**
   - Kafka topics for:
     * Driver location updates
     * Ride status changes
     * Payment events
     * Notifications
   - Consumer groups for scalable processing
   - Event persistence for analytics

3. **Caching Layer**

## üö¶ Audit Logging & Traceability

All critical admin and user actions are audit-logged for compliance and traceability:
- **User-Service**: All admin/user actions (PUT, POST, DELETE to `/api/users/**`) are logged to the `audit_logs` table. Paginated endpoint for review:
  - `GET /api/users/audit-logs?page=0&size=20` (ADMIN_READ required)
- **Driver-Service**: All admin actions (via HandlerInterceptor) are logged to the `audit_logs` table. Paginated endpoint for review:
  - `GET /api/v1/admin/audit-logs?page=0&size=20` (ADMIN role required)
- **Logging**: All key service methods use SLF4J logging for observability and debugging.

---

## üì° Real-Time Location Tracking & Notifications

- **Location-Tracking-Service**:
  - Consumes driver location updates from Kafka.
  - Persists locations in MySQL.
  - Provides REST APIs for querying locations:
    - `GET /api/driver/{driverId}/locations?limit=10` ‚Äì Recent locations for a driver
    - `GET /api/drivers/locations` ‚Äì Latest location for all drivers
    - `GET /api/drivers/locations/filter?city=...&status=...` ‚Äì Filtered by city/status
  - Broadcasts live locations via WebSocket.
  - Sends notification events to Kafka when driver status is AVAILABLE.

- **Notification-Service**:
  - Consumes notification events from Kafka.
  - Logs notification processing (stub for email/SMS/push).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run (Quick Start)

```powershell
# From the project root
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
# Then run:
docker-compose up --build
```

- User Service: http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html
- Driver Service: http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html
- Location Tracking Service: [port as configured]
- Notification Service: [port as configured]
- MySQL: localhost:3306 (user: root, pass: rootpass)

---

## üìà Extensibility
- Add more granular audit log details (e.g., request bodies, action types) as needed.
- Implement real notification channels (email, SMS, push) in notification-service.
- Add advanced analytics, geospatial queries, or further admin/user endpoints as needed.
